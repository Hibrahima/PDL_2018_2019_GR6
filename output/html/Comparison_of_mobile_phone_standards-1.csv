Signal quality/coverage area,Good coverage due to low frequencies,Good coverage indoors on 850/900 MHz. Repeaters possible. 35 km hard limit.,Unlimited cell size  low transmitter power permits large cells,Unlimited cell size  low transmitter power permits large cells,Smaller cells and lower indoors coverage on 2100 MHz; equivalent coverage indoors and superior range to GSM on 850/900 MHz.,
Frequency utilization/Call density,Very low density,0.2 MHz = 8 timeslots. Each timeslot can hold up to 2 calls (4 calls with VAMOS) through interleaving.,Lower than CDMA-2000?,1.228 MHz = 3Mbit/s,5 MHz = 2 Mbit/s. 42Mbit/s for HSPA+. Each call uses 1.8-12 kbit/s depending on chosen quality and audio complexity.,20 MHz
