Parameter,CRT,LCD,Plasma,OLED
Static Contrast ratio,Over 15.000:1[1],150 to 6.600:1[2][3],3800:1[4],"∞" "Inf:1"[5] Unable to be calculated as black levels are zero.
Peak Luminosity,176 cd/m²[1],276-1460 cd/m²[3],50-200 cd/m²[1],100-700 cd/m² [6]
Color depth,24-bit per pixel resolution; offers better resolution for grayscale,6 to 10-bit per subpixel panels;[7] smaller dot pitch  better detail[8],6 to 8-bit per subpixel panels; best color gamut[9][resource out of date  not impartial][10][resource out of date; source not credible/reputable],[empty]
Response time,Less than 1 µs[11],1–8 ms typical (according to manufacturer data)  older units could be as slow as 35 ms[12],Less than 1 µs; can get up to 0.001 µs[13],[empty]
Frame rate,60–85 fps typically  some CRTs can go even higher (200 fps at reduced resolution[14]); internally  display refreshed at input frame rate speed,60 fps typically  some can do 120 fps; internally  display refreshed at up to 240 Hz[15],60 fps typically  some can do 120 fps; internally  display refreshed at e.g. 480 or 600 Hz[16],[empty]
Environmental influences,Sensitive to ambient magnetic fields  which can adversely effect convergence and color purity.,Prone to malfunctions on both low (below -4 °F\-20 °C) or high (above 45 °C\113 °F) temperatures[17],High altitude pressure difference may cause poor function or buzzing noises[18],[empty]
Flicker,Perceptible on lower refresh rates (60 Hz and below)[19],Depends; as of 2013  most LCDs use PWM (strobing) to dim the backlight[20],Does not normally occur due to high refresh rate.[21],[empty]
Size,Up to 43",Up to 108"(2.78m)[22],Up to 150"(3.8m)[23],[empty]
Energy consumption and heat generation,High[24],Low[24],Varies with brightness but usually higher than LCD[25][26][27][28],[empty]
Maintenance,Hazardous to repair or service due to high-voltage  requires skilled convergence calibration and adjustments for geographic location changes.[29]Glass display tube is evacuated and carries risk of implosion if improperly handled.,Risky and expensive to repair due to complexity of the display;[30] units with mercury lamps are a minor environmental hazard[31],Screen itself cannot be repaired if the gas used to generate images leaks[32],[empty]
Electro-magnetic radiation emission,Can emit a small amount of X-ray radiation.,Only emits non-ionizing radiation.[33],Emits strong radio frequency electromagnetic radiation[34],[empty]
Other,No native resolution. Currently  the only display technology capable of multi-syncing (displaying different resolutions and refresh rates without the need for scaling).[35] Display lag is extremely low due to its nature  which does not have the ability to store image data before output  unlike LCDs  plasma displays and OLED displays.[36]Extremely bulky and heavy construction in comparison to other display technologies. Large displays would be unsuitable for wall mounting.,The LCD grid can mask effects of spatial and grayscale quantization  creating the illusion of higher image quality.[37],Screen-door effects are more noticeable than LCD when up close  or on larger sizes;[38] Risk of image retention or 'burn-in'.,Risk of image retention or 'burn-in'. Coloured sub-pixels may age at different rates  leading to a colour shift. Sensitive to UV light from direct sunlight.
