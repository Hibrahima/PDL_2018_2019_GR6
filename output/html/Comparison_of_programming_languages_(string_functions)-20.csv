Definition,left(string n) returns string
Description,Returns the left n part of a string. If n is greater than the length of the string then most implementations return the whole string (exceptions exist â€“ see code examples). Note that for variable-length encodings such as UTF-8  UTF-16 or Shift-JIS  it can be necessary to remove string positions at the end  in order to avoid invalid strings.
