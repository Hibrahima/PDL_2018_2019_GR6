Local ConFiGuration system (LCFG),Perl,GPL,<ref>LCFG does not provide its own transport mechanism; it relies on an external program  most often Apache. Using Apache it should be possible to do mutual authentication in several ways; however the documentation at The Complete Guide to LCFG  Section 9.4: Authorization and Security  shows access control based on IP address ranges  implying that the client does not authenticate itself to the server via an SSL certificate; it also does not mention if the LCFG client checks the validity of the server's SSL certificate (such as via a per-site fingerprint distributed with the client  or a chain of trust to an accredited CA). It mentions that there can be a per-client password in the profile  but also states that "The contents of the LCFG profile should be considered public".</ref>,<ref>LCFG supports encrypted communications channels (SSL via Apache); however the documentation at The Complete Guide to LCFG  Section 9.4: Authorization and Security  states that "The contents of the LCFG profile should be considered public".</ref>,[empty],[empty],[empty],1994,Weekly Releases
