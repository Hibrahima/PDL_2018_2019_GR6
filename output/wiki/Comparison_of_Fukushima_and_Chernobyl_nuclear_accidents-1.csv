Cause of the accident,The plants were not designed with consideration of such a large tsunami. A major earthquake and tsunami caused the destruction of power lines and backup generators. Once the plants were without external power and the generators were flooded  a catastrophic decay heat casualty ensued  leading to major reactor plant damage including meltdowns and explosive loss of reactor containment.,Proximate cause was human error and violation of procedures. The unsafe reactor design caused instability at low power due to a positive void coefficient and steam formation. When an improper test was conducted at 1:00 am at low power  the reactor became prompt critical. This was followed by a steam explosion that exposed the fuel  a raging fire  and a core meltdown. The fire lasted for days to weeks  and there is controversy over whether it was the fuel burning  nuclear decay heating or whether the graphite moderator that made up most of the core was involved. See Chernobyl Disaster  Note 1  for more discussion.
Maximum level of radiation detected,210 Sv/h inside Unit 2 containment vessel six years after meltdown.<ref name="ng-scorpion-210sv"></ref>,300 Sv/h shortly after the explosion in vicinity of the reactor core.<ref name="medv"></ref>
Radioactivity released,As of 2014  a peer reviewed estimate of the total was 340–780 PBq  with 80% falling into the Pacific Ocean.<ref></ref> Radiation continues to be released into the Pacific via groundwater.,<ref></ref><ref></ref>
Area affected,Radiation levels exceeding annual limits seen over to northwest and to south-southwest  according to officials.,An area up to away contaminated  according to the United Nations.
Exclusion Zone Area,20 km (30 km voluntary) extending north-west to 45 km in the downwind direction to Iitate  Fukushima<ref name=wna-201602></ref>,30 km
Population relocated,154.000<ref></ref>,335.000 (About 115.000 from areas surrounding the reactor in 1986; about 220.000 people from Belarus  the Russian Federation and Ukraine after 1986)
Direct fatalities from the accident,None,Two immediate trauma deaths; 28 deaths from Acute Radiation Syndrome out of 134 showing symptoms; four from an industrial accident (helicopter crash); 15 deaths from radiation-genic thyroid cancers (as of 2005)<ref></ref>
Current status,Cold shutdown declared on 16 December 2011  but decommissioning is likely to take 30 to 40 years.<ref></ref><ref name="guardian-20140310"></ref> All fuel rods in reactor 4 pool removed. Fukushima disaster cleanup is ongoing.,All reactors were shut down by 2000. The damaged reactor was covered by a hastily built steel and concrete structure called the sarcophagus. A New Safe Confinement structure was installed in November 2016  from which the plant will be cleaned up and decommissioned.
