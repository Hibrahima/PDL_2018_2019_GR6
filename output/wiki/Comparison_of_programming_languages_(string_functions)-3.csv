Definition,compare(string1 string2) returns integer.
Description,Compares two strings to each other. If they are equivalent  a zero is returned. Otherwise  most of these routines will return a positive or negative result corresponding to whether string1 is lexicographically greater than  or less than  respectively  than string2. The exceptions are the Scheme and Rexx routines which return the index of the first mismatch  and Smalltalk which answer a comparison code telling how the receiver sorts relative to string parameter.
