Symplectic Elements,Clients have the ability to integrate with existing web profile management systems  export data for business intelligence solutions and easily submit research outcomes for various government assessment exercises. This includes HR  publications  teaching activities  grants  institutional repositories  and any other system providing or consuming research data.,Elements integrates with a variety of external systems including: Altmetric  figshare  ORCID  SHERPA/RoMEO (licensing information)  DOAJ (licensing information),Elements can be linked to all major open repository technologies and an open source VIVO Harvester extension is also available.,
VIVO,Data can be ingested from a wide variety of local sources (including HR  grants  course databases  institutional repositories  membership rosters  research interests  and many others) to reflect a complete view of the institution's priorities and efforts.,see mini-grants <http://www.vivoweb.org/blog/2011/01/award-announcement-vivo-collaborative-research-projects-program>; eagle-i; Drupal; many others - any tool that can consume open linked data. Other ongoing collaborations with Wellspring (maintaining VIVO profiles with a focus upon tech transfer and also as a 3rd party implementation service provider) and with Symplectic.,VIVO collaborates with eagle-I on research resources. Future plans include adding many additional data types which are meaningful in the academic research setting. VIVO data are structured using a comprehensive ontology designed for local extension and major ontology "plugins" such as BIBO and eagle-i.,VIVO Consortium received $12.2M NIH ARRA U24 award in 2009 to fully develop software and create national system of federated research expertise directories/research networking systems; All other semantic web-compliant software platforms can be integrated into the consortium (example: Harvard Profiles).
