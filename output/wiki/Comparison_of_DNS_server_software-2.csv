pdnsd,,<ref> "pdnsd was started on Linux  and has since been ported to FreeBSD (and Cygwin and Darwin). 90% of the source code should be easily portable to POSIX- and BSD-compatible systems  provided that those systems support the POSIX threads (pthreads). The rest might need OS-specific rewrites."</ref>,,,
